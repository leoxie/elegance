Contribution Guides
--------------------------------------

In the spirit of open source software development, jQuery always encourages community code contribution. To help you get started and before you jump into writing code, be sure to read these important contribution guidelines thoroughly:

1. [Getting Involved](http://docs.jquery.com/Getting_Involved)
2. [Core Style Guide](http://docs.jquery.com/JQuery_Core_Style_Guidelines)
3. [Tips For Bug Patching](http://docs.jquery.com/Tips_for_jQuery_Bug_Patching)


What you need to build your own jQuery
--------------------------------------

In order to build jQuery, you need to have Node.js/npm latest and git 1.7 or later.
(Earlier versions might work OK, but are not tested.)

Windows users have two options:

1. Install [msysgit](https://code.google.com/p/msysgit/) (Full installer for official Git) and a
   [binary version of Node.js](http://nodejs.org). Make sure all two packages are installed to the same
   location (by default, this is C:\Program Files\Git).
2. Install [Cygwin](http://cygwin.com/) (make sure you install the git and which packages), and
   a [binary version of Node.js](http://nodejs.org/).
